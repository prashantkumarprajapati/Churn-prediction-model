📊 Customer Churn Prediction Model

🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning–based Customer Churn Prediction Model to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service. The goal is to help businesses take proactive actions to retain at-risk customers by leveraging data-driven insights.

🎯 Objectives

Identify customers with a high probability of churn

Analyze key factors influencing customer churn

Build and evaluate machine learning models for accurate prediction

🧠 Approach & Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and outliers

Encoded categorical variables

Scaled numerical features for better model performance

Feature Engineering:

Selected relevant features impacting customer behavior

Removed redundant and less informative attributes

Model Development:

Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

(Add others if used)

Compared models based on performance metrics

📈 Model Evaluation

Evaluated models using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Selected the best-performing model for final predictions

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

🚀 Outcome

The final model successfully identifies at-risk customers with high accuracy, enabling businesses to implement effective retention strategies and reduce customer churn.
